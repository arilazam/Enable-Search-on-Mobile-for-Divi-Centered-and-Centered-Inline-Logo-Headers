# Enable-Search-on-Mobile-for-Divi-Centered-and-Centered-Inline-Logo-Headers
Just like other WordPress themes, Divi has the search functionality integrated into its header. Search is available for all five of its header formats except for the Centered and Centered Inline Logo headers for which the search functionality is disabled on mobile devices. Since currently there is no any options provided within Divi theme which would allow enabling search on mobile devices for these headers too, this needs a custom solution. I am going to show you how to do it manually using only CSS.

I’ve prepared the CSS snippet and provide it below, so, all you need to do is to copy it and paste into the Divi -> Theme Customizer -> Additional CSS section (or alternatively go to Divi -> Theme Options and paste this snippet into Custom CSS field) or into your child theme style.css file. I’ve included comments for each part of it expalining what it does to make it easier to understand.

There is one important requirement however – for this snippet to work you have to have the search icon enabled in Theme Customizer settings. Make sure it is enabled by going to Divi -> Theme Customizer -> Header & Navigation -> Header Elements and check the “Show search icon” checkbox.

That’s all, hope you enjoyed this CSS snippet.
